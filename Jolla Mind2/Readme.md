# Your Life, Data, and AI. In a Box.
##Jolla Mind2 Personal AI Assistant

Jolla published their AI box approach late 2024 (actually I think they made first annoucement already around May 2024) and I made my pre-order of the device almost immediately, their approach to build local non-cloud based AI assistant is interesting option for anyone who wants to let AI read personal documents and emails. As they say at their [homepage](https://www.jollamind2.com):

_Meet Mind 2, your personal AI assistant that changes everything, designed to work for you and protect what matters most: your time, data, and peace of mind. No cloud storage risks, just streamlined productivity and total control over your digital life. Mind2 isn’t just another tool; it’s your productivity partner, tailored to help you thrive on your terms_

And today I finally received my unit, I will try to document initial thoughts and feelings about Mind2 as I start use it.
